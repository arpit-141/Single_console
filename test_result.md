# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##

##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "🚀 UNIFIED SECURITY CONSOLE V2.0 - PRODUCTION-READY IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

**MAJOR CHANGES IMPLEMENTED:**

**Backend (Production-Ready):**
✅ JWT-based authentication system with configurable auth types (simple/keycloak)
✅ Centralized configuration management via environment variables  
✅ Enhanced application models with role sync support
✅ Generic role synchronization framework (not DefectDojo-specific)
✅ Comprehensive app templates for 10+ security tools
✅ Password hashing, data encryption, proper error handling
✅ Default admin user creation (username: admin, password: admin123)

**Frontend (Complete Overhaul):**
✅ React Context-based authentication with protected routes
✅ Beautiful login UI with auth type detection
✅ Module-based access control throughout the app
✅ Dedicated Applications page with filtering and role sync
✅ Enhanced Admin panel with template-based app management
✅ Comprehensive user management interface
✅ Role synchronization buttons per application
✅ DefectDojo is now just another app (not hardcoded)

**NEW FEATURES:**
🔐 Configurable authentication (switch between simple auth and Keycloak via .env)
🎯 Role sync framework supports multiple app types (DefectDojo working, others ready)
🏗️ App templates make adding new security tools straightforward
👥 Module-based user access control (XDR, XDR+, OXDR, GSOS)
🔄 Individual role sync per application with status tracking
📊 Enhanced dashboard with auth type and role sync status

**TESTING REQUIRED:**
- Login/logout functionality with JWT tokens
- Application creation using different templates
- Role synchronization for DefectDojo applications
- Module-based access restrictions
- Admin vs regular user permissions
- Password change functionality
- Application filtering and search

**CREDENTIALS:**
- Default admin: username='admin', password='admin123'
- Auth type is configurable via AUTH_TYPE environment variable (currently 'simple')
- JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration

Ready for comprehensive testing of all authentication and application management features."
